        <h2 class="h2-div">About Tesla</h2>
        <p>Tesla Motors, Inc. has been a trailblazer in the electric car market for years. From its humble origins
            building electric roadsters on modified Lotus chassis, Tesla has become a force to be reckoned with. Now a
            household name, Tesla makes up a significant portion of the EV market worldwide. With a range of four
            exciting models and development of a few more, Tesla is definitely an important factor in the
            electric car industry.</p>
        <h2 class="h2-div">Why should you buy Tesla?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="div-ul">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No gasoline - </strong> At the heart of a Tesla is the electric drivetrain. It is the reason the
                company exists. For years people have tried to figure out how to get rid of gasoline power and nobody
                did it with much success until Tesla came along. No gas means no exhaust, and that makes driving a Tesla
                significantly better for the environment than driving a vehicle with an internal combustion engine.</li>
            <li><strong>Innovative tech - </strong>Tesla vehicles were some of the first to use large touch screens for
                the bulk of the cars' functions and helped redefine how we interact with our vehicles. The company also
                pioneered self-driving and introduced the idea of having a nationwide charging network. The engineering
                that manages the battery is also complex and highly advanced, and Tesla is among the first makers to
                build an electric car with a range long enough to make it viable for most people's daily use. Regardless
                of how many features exist or how many you might use, the innovation and novel features of every Tesla
                make great arguments for why you should drive one.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Direct sales - </strong>Every Tesla vehicle is sold directly to the consumer. This gives Tesla
                full control of the experience and eliminates the possibility of unscrupulous dealers taking advantage
                of its customers.</li>
            <li><strong>Mature technology - </strong>Tesla may be one of the youngest automakers, it has been building
                volume production all-electric vehicles probably longer than most other manufacturers. Tesla is the
                first company to build electric cars and a companion network of chargers and has been doing it long
                enough that Superchargers can be found all over the world. Going with a company with a proven track
                record of successfully delivering a quality product can be reassuring when choosing what car to buy, and
                should be a consideration for choosing the Tesla.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal maintenance - </strong>With a lack of most of the moving parts of an internal combustion
                engine, EVs lack the need for oil changes, belt replacements, filters, and most fluids. Regular
                maintenance intervals require little more than a visual inspection, especially since the computer
                monitors the battery and motors constantly and provides alerts when something needs attention. With all
                that in mind, cheap maintenance is definitely a huge incentive to buy a Tesla.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Styling - </strong>While the technology and engineering are both highly progressive and
                forward-thinking, the styling is somewhat reserved and understated. Perhaps the most appealing aspect is
                the minimalist approach to interior design. You will not find any superfluous knobs, buttons, or
                flourishes of any kind. Everything has a function and the rest is sleek and sparse. That can be a
                positive attribute as busy interior design can be offputting and ugly. For those who appreciate vehicles
                with elegant but understated features, the Tesla remains a good choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety - </strong>This is undoubtedly one of Tesla's main advantages! All Tesla cars have been
                rated 5 stars by the NHTSA, which is the highest rating possible. With the inherent stability and the
                complement of dozens of airbags and high-strength steel used in the construction, few cars are safer on
                the road than Tesla.
