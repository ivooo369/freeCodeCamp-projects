            <h3>Here's a time line of Steve Jobs's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1955</strong> - Born on 24th of February 1955 in San Francisco, California.</li>
                <li><strong>1973</strong> - Attends, but later drops out of Reed College. Then he starts to travel
                    through India until 1974. During his time in India, Steve Jobs becomes more interested in Buddhism.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1975</strong> - After coming back from traveling through India, Steve Jobs starts working on
                    Apple I Computer together with Steve Woz. Steve Wozniak attends the first meeting of the Homebrew
                    Computer Club in Gordon French's garage on March 5, 1975. He is so moved that he begins to work on
                    what
                    would become the Apple I computer right away. After creating one for himself and demonstrating it to
                    the club, he and Steve Jobs distribute schematics (technical designs) for the computer to
                    interested club members, as well as assisting some of them in building and testing prototypes. Then
                    Steve Jobs proposed that they develop and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit board just
                    the bare board, no electronic components that customers could use to make computers. Wozniak
                    predicts that laying out the board design would cost $1,000, with production costing a further $20
                    per board. The start of selling their first computer was set into motion.</li>
                <li><strong>1976</strong> - On the 1st of April 1976 Apple Inc. is incorporated by Steve Jobs, Steve
                    Wozniak and Ron Wayne. The Apple I goes on sale in July 1976 for $666.66 because Wozniak "loved
                    repeating numbers" and because the wholesale price of $500 increased by a third. The first units
                    produced were used in high school math classes and donated to Liza Loop's Public Access Computer
                    Center. About 200 were produced and all but 25 were sold within 9 or 10 months.</li>
                <li><strong>1984</strong> - Macintosh is launched at Apple's annual shareholder meeting.</li>
                <li><strong>1985</strong> - Leaves Apple and starts a new computer firm NeXT.</li>

                <li><strong>2000</strong> - He is back as CEO at Apple Inc.</li>

                    Jobs unveils iWork, the Mac mini, iPod shuffle and Mac OS X 10.4.</li>
                <li><strong>2007</strong> - Introduction of iPhone, Apple TV and iPod Touch. Apple Computers becomes
                    Apple Inc.</li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - Takes medical leave for six months and has surgery for liver
                    transplant.</li>
